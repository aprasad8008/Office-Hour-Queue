# Office-Hour-Queue
Built a JavaFX application, called OfficeHourQueue which: 
Allows students to type their names into a text box and add themselves to the queue by clicking a button.
Allow TAs to press a “dequeue” button to remove the student at the head of the queue (privileged action).
Display the queue, with the most recently added students at the bottom of the queue.
Display the current size of the queue, along with the maximum size the queue has ever reached.
For privileged actions, the program displays a pop-up asking the user for a password.
